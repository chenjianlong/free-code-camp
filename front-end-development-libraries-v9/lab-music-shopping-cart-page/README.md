# Build a Music Shopping Cart Page

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have an element with an `id` called `shopping-cart-container`.
2. Your `#shopping-cart-container` element should use the correct utility class for setting the element to a Flexbox layout.
3. Your `#shopping-cart-container` element should set the direction of flex items to column for smaller devices and row for larger devices. Remember that Tailwind CSS utilizes the mobile first approach and you will use the `lg:` breakpoint prefix to target larger devices.
4. Inside your `#shopping-cart-container` element, you should have an element with an `id` called `products-container`.
5. Your `#products-container` element should have at least two child elements each with a class called `card`.
6. Each `.card` element should have the following elements nested inside:
    * An `h2` element with text representing the product name, and a utility class that sets the font size using only predefined size classes such as `text-sm`, `text-md`, `text-lg`, `text-xl`, `text-2xl`, etc.
    * An element with a class called `quantity` and text for the number of cart items for that product.
    * An element with a class called `price` and text for the price.
    * A `button` with a class called `remove-button` and text `Remove`. Your button should have utility classes for a predefined red background color of your choosing and different predefined red background color for the hover state. Examples of predefined red background colors include `bg-red-500`, `bg-red-600`, etc. Examples of predefined hover red background colors include `hover:bg-red-500`, `hover:bg-red-600`, etc.
7. Inside your `#shopping-cart-container` element, you should have an element with an `id` called `order-summary-container`.
8. Your `#order-summary-container` element should have the following styles:
    * A utility class of your choosing for predefined rounded corners. Examples include `rounded`, `rounded-lg`, `rounded-full`, etc.
    * A utility class of your choosing for setting the border width on all sides.
9. Your `#order-summary-container` element should have the following elements nested inside:
    * An `h2` element with the text `Order Summary` and a utility class of your choosing that sets the font size.
    * An element with the text `Total:` and `id` set to `total`. This element should also use utility classes to set the font weight to a predefined Tailwind CSS font weight and font size of your choosing for the element.
    * An element with an `id` set to `total-amount` to display the total for all items in the cart.
    * A link with the text `Checkout` and the correct utility class for centering the text. The `href` value should be set to `#`. Your link should also have a utility class for setting the background color to a predefined Tailwind CSS blue color of your choosing and a different blue background color for the hover state.
