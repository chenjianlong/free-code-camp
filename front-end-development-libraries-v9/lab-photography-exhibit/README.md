**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

2. Your `.main-container` element should also have the following Tailwind CSS utility classes:
    * the correct utility class for creating a CSS Grid container.
    * a utility class for defining the number of columns within the grid. You should use the utility class that utilizes the fixed number of columns. Ex. `grid-cols-<number>`.
    * a utility class for setting the row and column gap for the grid items.
3. Inside your `.main-container` element, there should be at least three elements each with a class called `card`.
4. Each of your `.card` elements should also have the following Tailwind CSS utility classes:
