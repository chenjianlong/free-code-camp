# Build an All-True Property Validator

In this lab you will test a specific property of each object in an array to see if it always has a truthy value or not.

For example, you could be asked to test one property of the objects in an array like the following:

```js
[{
    name: "Quincy",
    role: "Founder",
    isBot: false
}, {
    name: "Naomi",
    role: "",
    isBot: false
}, {
    name: "Camperbot",
    role: "Bot",
    isBot: true
}]
```

If you were asked to test the `name` property, in the objects of this array the property `name` has the values of `"Quincy"`, `"Naomi"`, and `"Camperbot"`, so it is always truthy.

If you were asked to test the `role` property, the values are `"Founder"`, `""`, and `"Bot"`, in this case `""` is a falsy value, so the values are not always truthy.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a function named `truthCheck`.
2. The `truthCheck` function takes two arguments: an array of objects and a string representing a property name found in those objects.
3. The function should check if the property with the name equal to the second argument has a truthy value in all the objects of the array, and return `true` if it has, and `false` otherwise.
