# Build a Customer Complaint Form

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

For this lab, you have been provided with all the HTML and CSS. You will use JavaScript to validate the complaint form.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. When the form is submitted, you should ensure that:
    * `#full-name` is not empty.
    * `#email` is a valid email address format.
    * `#order-no` is a sequence of ten numbers starting with `2024`.
    * `#product-code` follows the pattern `XX##-X###-XX#`, where `X` represents either a lowercase letter or an uppercase letter and `#` represents a number.
    * `#quantity` is a positive integer.
    * at least one checkbox from `#complaints-group` is checked.
    * `#complaint-description` contains at least twenty characters if the `Other` checkbox is checked.
    * a radio button from `#solutions-group` is selected.
    * `#solution-description` contains at least twenty characters if the `Other` radio button is selected.
2. You should have a function named `validateForm` that returns an object containing the following keys: `full-name`, `email`, `order-no`, `product-code`, `quantity`, `complaints-group`, `complaint-description`, `solutions-group`, and `solution-description`. The value of each key should be `true` if the corresponding form field is correctly filled and `false` otherwise.
3. You should have a function named `isValid` that takes the object returned by `validateForm` as argument and returns `true` if every form field is correctly filled and `false` otherwise.
4. If a change event is triggered on a form field and it has a valid value, you should set its border color to `green`. In case of checkbox and radio button groups, you should set the border color of the parent `fieldset`.
5. If a change event is triggered on a form field and it has an invalid value, you should set its border color to `red`. In case of checkbox and radio button groups, you should set the border color of the parent `fieldset`.
6. When you try to submit the form you should call `isValid` to validate the form.
7. When you try to submit the form, if the form has any invalid field, each invalid field should be highlighted by setting the border color of each invalid input, textarea or fieldset (in case of checkbox and radio button groups) to `red`.
