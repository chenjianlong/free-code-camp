# Create a Deep Flattening Tool

In this lab, you will be implementing an array flattening algorithm.

Flattening an array means turning a nested array of any depth into a single, one-dimensional array. The process extracts all elements in order, unwrapping only arrays. Other types are left unchanged.

For example:

|Original|Flattened|
|-|-|
|`[[1], [], [2, [3]]]`|`[1, 2, 3]`|
|`[1, {"foo": "bar"}, [2]]`|`[1, {"foo": "bar"}, 2]`|
|`["baz", [1, 2], {}]`|`["baz", 1, 2, {}]`|

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a function named `steamrollArray`.
2. The `steamrollArray` function should accept one argument: a nested array.
3. The function should flatten the nested array, accounting for varying levels of nesting.
4. Your solution should not use the `Array.prototype.flat()` or `Array.prototype.flatMap()` methods.
5. Global variables should not be used.
