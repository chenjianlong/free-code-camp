# Build a Smart Word Replacement Function

In this lab, you will create a function that performs a search and replace on the sentence using the arguments provided and then returns the new sentence.

**Note:** Preserve the case of the first character in the original word when you are replacing it. For example if you mean to replace the word `Book` with the word `dog`, it should be replaced as `Dog`

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should create a function named `myReplace`.
2. The `myReplace` function should take three arguments: a string, a word to be replaced, and the word to replace it with.
3. The `myReplace` function should return the new string with the replacement.
4. You should preserve the case of the first character in the original word when you are replacing it.
