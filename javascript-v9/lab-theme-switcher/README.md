# Build a Theme Switcher

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

In this lab, you will build an app that switches between different themes. When you switch to a different theme, the background color will change and a different message will display.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a `button` element with the text `Switch Theme`.
2. Your `button` element should have the following attributes:
    * An `id` attribute set to `"theme-switcher-button"`.
    * An `aria-haspopup` attribute set to `"true"`.
    * An `aria-expanded` attribute set to `"false"`.
    * An `aria-controls` attribute set to `"theme-dropdown"`.
3. You should have a `ul` element with the following attributes:
    * An `id` attribute set to `"theme-dropdown"`.
    * A `role` attribute set to `"menu"`.
    * An `aria-labelledby` attribute set to `"theme-switcher-button"`.
    * A `hidden` attribute.
4. Your `ul` element should have at least two `li` elements with a `role` attribute set to `"menuitem"` and text of your choice representing a different theme.
5. Each of your `li` elements should have an `id` attribute that starts with `theme-` and ends with the theme you set for the `li` element text. For example, if one of your themes is `Light` then your `id` should be `theme-light`.
6. You should have an element with an `aria-live` attribute set to `"polite"`.
7. You should have a `themes` array with at least two objects that each contain a `name` and `message` property. The `name` will represent a different theme and the `message` will display when the theme switches. You are free to come up with `name` and `message` values of your choice but the `name` values should match one of the options you set in your `li` items.
8. When a user clicks on the `#theme-switcher-button`, the `#theme-dropdown` element should display the available themes.
9. When the `#theme-dropdown` element is displayed, the `aria-expanded` attribute should be set to `"true"` for the `button` element.
10. When the users clicks on the `#theme-switcher-button` while the `#theme-dropdown` element is displayed, the menu should be closed and the `hidden` attribute should be added and the `aria-expanded` attribute should be set to `"false"`.
11. When a user clicks on the `#theme-switcher-button` and selects a theme, the corresponding `theme-<name>` class should be added to the `body` element and the related theme message you set in the `themes` array should display in the `aria-live="polite"` element.
