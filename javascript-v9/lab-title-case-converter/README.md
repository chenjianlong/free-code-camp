# Build a Title Case Converter

In this lab you will create a function that converts a string to title case. Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized and the rest of the word is in lower case.

`"Web Development Is Awesome"` is an example of a title cased string.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.
