# Implement a Unique Sorted Union

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a function named `uniteUnique`.
2. The `uniteUnique` function should accept two or more arrays as arguments.
3. The function should return a new array that contains unique values from the argument arrays, in the order they are first found in the arguments. For example, an input like `[1, 2, 4], [2, 3, 5]` would have an output of `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.
