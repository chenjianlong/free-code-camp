# Implement a Value Remover Function

In this lab, you will create a function that takes an initial array as its first argument, followed by one or more additional arguments representing the values to remove.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a `destroyer` function that accepts an array and one or more additional arguments.
2. The `destroyer` function should return a new array excluding all elements from the first argument that match any of the subsequent arguments.
3. The function must accept an indeterminate number of arguments.
